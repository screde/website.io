<h2>
 Improve navigation system design
</h2>
<p>In a fast-paced digital society, individuals increasingly rely on computerized location-based services to efficiently find their way through unfamiliar environments. However, scientific evidence is showing that despite digital navigation assistance helping people to find their way, it can cause wayfinders to become ``mindless’‘of the traversed environment, thus acquiring no or very little spatial knowledge in the long term. It is still not entirely clear what causes these impairments or how the design of navigation devices can be improved to counteract such undesirable effects. One promising solution to counteract the negative influeces of using such devices on spatial learning may be the inclusion of global landmarks. In my PhD project, I investigated if paying attention to globally visible landmarks in the environment may increase our spatial knowledge even in situations of limited cognitive resources, for example when a navigator is experiencing stress. My findings revealed that globally visible landmarks can improve spatial learning during navigation. Additionally, I have identified a number of cognitive and contextual conditions that impair users’ ability to take advantage of globally visible landmarks for spatial learning. Based on these conditions, I could provide empirically grounded design guidelines for future learning-aware navigation systems. Check out my doctoral thesis, if you want to know more! <br/><br/></p>

<h2>
 Adapt layout design to wayfinders expactations
</h2>
<p>Even though indoor wayfinding processes may seem very natural and simple, people often get lost during the search for destinations. If we know what people expect of a buildings structure, we can use this knowledge to improve building design. In my Master’s, I studied peoples’ expectations of a building’s geometry beyond the current line of sight. Do such expectations rely on configurational variables (e.g., symmetry, good form) of the currently perceived building part? By having participants watch virtual building walks we systematically examined how configurational variables influenced expectations about the hallway structure of unknown building parts. The results of this study demonstrate that during indoor navigation, people use backgreound knowledge and tend to expect closed hallway structures and symmetrical layouts. Insights of peoples’ spatial expectation should be considered in the design of building layouts or when planning emergency exits. <br/><br/></p>

<h2>
 Profile pictures portray identity
</h2>
<p>Who am I? Is my identity innate or can I define it myself? The technical term individualization describes not only a personal urge to be unique, but also the modern task of the individual to constitute himself as an something special. In this research project, I have examined the role of social media and the profile picture in the production of one’s self-image or psychological identity. With the help of qualitative, empirical methods, I was able to show that social media is an integral part of younger people’s social practice and their personal identity. This was most clearly expressed in the interviewees critical judgments about social media practices of others. Specifically, the findings of this study have shown that online self-presentation is critically evaluated according to its correspondance with offline ‘reality’. The interviewees often justify their criticism of others with the common sense conception of identity as being something fixed and coherent that should not differ between situations.</p>
